Rocket explained by the project creator:

``Rocket is an intuitive new way of... bah, whatever. It's a sync-tracker, a tool for
synchronizing music and visuals in demoscene productions. It consists of a GUI editor
(using Qt), and an ANSI C library that can either communicate with the editor over a
network socket, or play back an exported data-set.``
